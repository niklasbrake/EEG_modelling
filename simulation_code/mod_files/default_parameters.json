        "synapse_parameters": "Synaptic weight parameter is the maximal conductance of the synapse and has units of mS. Time scales have units of ms. e is the reversal potential of the synapse and has units of mV. Idx is a parameter that will be replaed by the segments index of each synapses.",
        "cell_parameters": "firingRate is the average firing rate of excitatory/inhibitory presynaptic neurons, units are in Hz. multiSynapseCount is the number of synapses per connection. Markram et al. suggests excitatory cells may make up to 3.6 synapses/connections and inhibitory cells may make up to 13.9 synapses/connections. Here, we simply use 1 synapse/connection, but may be changed in the future."
        "pas_mem_pars": "Ra is the axial resistance and has units of Ohm*cm. erev_leak is the reversal potential of the leak current in all compartments, and has units of mV. g_leak is the maximal conductance of the leak channels in all compartments, and has units of  S/cm^2.
